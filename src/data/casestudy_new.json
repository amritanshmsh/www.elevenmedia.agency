While they were seeing success with their offline sales, their online store was struggling to convert. Their best-selling product offline was a travel backpack, priced at ₹9,000.

We began by diving deep into the brand's ad account, reviewing past campaigns, their website, and their ad creatives. We quickly found several issues: Low conversion rates (just 0.2%), minimal engagement on their backpack ads, pixel optimization was way off at only 30%, and there was no proper product testing happening."

While their travel backpack was the top seller offline, we tested a different travel product that started showing promise and quickly scaled that product."

It might affect sales for a few days, but trust the process.' Sales dropped from ₹15K/day to ₹7K/day for 7 days while we set up proper funnels with exclusions, created fresh lookalike audiences, and launched 5–6 new creatives plus 5 variations of the old winner."

We cut all underperformers and focused solely on these two, using different hooks and targeting combinations."

By month three, we hit ₹1.2L/day in sales. The scale was so intense that the client had to ask us to pause campaigns for a few days due to stock and packing issues.",

By the fourth month, sales were consistently at ₹1.2L/day with 2.5x ROAS. The takeaway: If you're patient with the process and trust data-backed decisions, any brand with product–market fit and a unique angle can be scaled to unimaginable levels."
